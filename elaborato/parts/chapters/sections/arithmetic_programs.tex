\section{Arithmetic Programs}
Suppose we have some algebra \(\mathbb{A}\): we can represent and deal with finite sequences of 
operations, called \emph{expressions}, between elements of \(\mathbb{A}\) and/or variables over 
\(\mathbb{A}\).

For example, given the expression \(x^2 + x + 1\) over \(\mathbb{R}\left[x\right]\), we might be 
interested to know what is the \emph{evaluation} of the expression given some value for \(x\).
