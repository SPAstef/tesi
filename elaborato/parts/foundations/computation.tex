\chapter{An Overview of Proof Systems}\label{chap:computation}
Proving theorems is an activity which has always been considered highly intellectual, and 
even today most theorems are proven ``by hand''. 
But what does it really mean to prove a theorem? Is finding a proof for a theorem really harder 
than checking whether said proof is valid? And is it possible to prove to someone that a theorem is 
true, without revealing why that is so?

In this chapter, after introducing the required concepts \emph{computation and complexity theory} 
in \Cref{sec:interactive_tm} and \Cref{sec:complexity}, we give an overview of 
\emph{interactive proof systems} in \Cref{sec:interactive_proof_systems}, and the history 
of their \emph{zero-knowledge} counterparts in \Cref{sec:zero_knowledge}.
