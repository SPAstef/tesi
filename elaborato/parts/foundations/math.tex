\chapter{Mathematical Background}\label{chap:math}
In this chapter we will introduce all the mathematical concepts behind ZKP and ZK-friendly 
functions.
While we decided, for completeness, to include even some of the more fundamental notions, we still
expect the reader to have at least a rough idea of these concepts.
\Cref{sec:prime_fields} will introduce prime fields, cyclic groups other related notions.
