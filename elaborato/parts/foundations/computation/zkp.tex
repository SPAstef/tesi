\section{Zero-Knowledge Protocols}
Suppose that two parties are executing an IARK system for some hard problem: the instance is places 
on the shared input tape, and also suppose that the secret in possession of the prover is simply 
a witness for the instance. 
All the prover has to do is send the witness to the verifier, which will in turn check it and 
decide whether to accept or not.
In this process, the verifier gained more knowledge than just the solvability of the problem: it 
also learned a solution, and not just any solution, but exactly the one available to the prover,
which should have been a secret.
To address this issue, researchers started exploring the field of so-called zero-knowledge 
proofs~\cite{GoldwasserMR1989,GoldreichMW1991}.

Informally, two random variables \(U\) and \(V\) that map words of some language 
\(L \subseteq \Set{0, 1}^{*}\) to words of \(\Set{0, 1}^{*}\) are 
\emph{perfectly indistinguishable} when no unbounded Turing machine is able to tell them apart,
are \emph{statistically indistinguishable} when no \textsc{PSPACE} Turing machine is able to 
tell them apart, and are \emph{computationally indistinguishable} when no \textsc{PTIME} Turing 
machine \(\mathcal{M}\) is able to tell them apart.
By `telling apart', we mean that the distribution of the words that are accepted/rejected 
by Turing machines respecting the imposed bounds is independent from \(U\) and \(V\): intuitively,
this means that \(U\) and \(V\) are interchangable with each other and using one over the other 
does not give an `edge' to \(\mathcal{M}\)~\cite{GoldwasserM1984,GoldwasserMR1989,Yao1982}.
\begin{example}
  Consider the two random variables \(U, V: L \to \Set{0, 1}^{*}\) for some 
  \(L \subseteq \Set{0, 1}^{*}\), such that, for all words \(x \in L\) and all words 
  \(w \in \Set{0, 1}^{\abs{x}}\), it holds that:
  \begin{align*}
    & \call{\Pr}{\call{U}{x} = w} = 2^{-\abs{x}} &&
    \call{\Pr}{\call{V}{x} = w} = \begin{cases}
      0 & x = 0\dots0 \\
      2^{-\abs{x} + 1} & x = 1\dots1 \\
      2^{-\abs{x}} & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  \(U\) and \(V\) have \emph{almost} the same distribution, with the \(1\dots1\) string 
  happening twice as often in \(V\). 
  For increasingly longer strings, no Turing machine can tell the two distributions apart by 
  collecting a polynomial amount of samples, since 
  \(\sum_{w}{\abs{\call{\Pr}{\call{U}{x} = w} - \call{\Pr}{\call{V}{x} = w}}} = 2^{-\abs{x}+1}\),
  hence \(U\) and \(V\) are statistically indistinguishable.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Tape view]
  A \emph{tape view} is a random variable \(\View_{\mathcal{M}}\) that models the concatenation 
  of all the contents that are read/written by a halting Turing machine \(\mathcal{M}\) over its 
  tapes.
\end{definition}

For a deterministic, non-probabilistic Turing machine, the tape view variable is quite pointless, 
but it is a useful tool to model the behaviour of machines that exploit randomness, and expecially 
for interactive protocols.
For example, if we have a Turing machine with one tape \(\Tape \), then:
\[
  \call{\Pr}{\call{\View_{\mathcal{M}}}{x} = w} = 
  \call{\Pr}{\call{\View_{\mathcal{M}, \Tape}}{x} = w} = 
  \call{\Pr}{\call{\mathcal{M}}{x} = w}
\]


\begin{definition}[Approximability]
  A random variable \(U\) is (perfectly, statistically, computationally) \emph{approximable} by a 
  probabilistic Turing machine \(\mathcal{M}\) over some language \(L\) if \(U\) and 
  \(\View_{\mathcal{M}}\) are (perfectly, statistically, computationally) indistinguishable.
\end{definition}

Note that for a random variable \(U\) and a halting PTM \(\mathcal{M}\) to be perfectly 
indistinguishable over some language \(L\), it must be the case that 
\(\forall x \in L\colon \call{\mathcal{M}}{x} = \call{\View_{\mathcal{M}}}{x} = \call{\mathcal{U}}{x}\).

\begin{definition}[Zero-knowledge interactive protocol]
  A (perfectly, statistically, computationally) \emph{Zero-knowledge interactive protocol} (ZKIP) 
  over a language \(L \subseteq \Set{0, 1}^{*}\) is an interactive protocol 
  \(\mathcal{I} = \Tuple{\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{M}'}\) such that, for every \(\mathcal{M'}\),
  \(\View_{\mathcal{M'}}\) is (perfectly, statistically, computationally) approximable by a 
  Turing machine \(\mathcal{M}''\) over the language 
  \(L' = \Set{\Tuple{x, h} \mid x \in L \wedge w \in \Set{0, 1}^*}\), where the string
  \(h\) represents the initial content of \(\Tapework'\).
\end{definition}

Naturally, a ZKIP which is also a proof system is a zero-knowledge proof system (ZKPS); similarly, 
if it is an interactive argument of knowledge system then it is a zero-knowledge interactive 
argument of knowledge system (ZK-IARK).
From now on, by zero-knowledge we mean computational zero-knowledge, as assuming a polynomial-time 
bounded adversary is an acceptable restriction in the real world.
The initial string \(h\) of a ZKIP can be interpreted as the \emph{history} of previous 
interactions with the prover, or some eavesdropped information from the interactions that the 
prover had with other verifiers.

A proof system being zero-knowledge basically means that, even for curious or malicious verifiers,
and even with additional knowledge on the behaviour of the prover, what can be computed is nothing 
more than what could have been computed in polynomial time, hence within the imposed computational 
power limits, without communicating with the prover.
While it is obvious that every problem solvable in probabilistic polynomial time 
(\textsc{PP}) has a zero-knowledge proof system (the prover does nothing and the verifier computes 
the solution by himself), it was proven that also all problems in \textsc{NP} have a 
ZKPS~\cite{GoldreichMW1991}. 
By assuming the existance of secure probabilistic encryption, it was finally shown that also 
all Arthur-Merlin games, and hence all problems in \textsc{IP}, have a ZKPS~\cite{BenorGGHKMR1990}.

\subsection{Non interactive Zero-Knowledge}
In many scenarios, especially ones involving multiple parties, interaction can be a problem as
the communication cost of bidirectional \(n\)-to-\(n\) grows quadratically.
Such cases are actually the ones in which zero-knowledge systems are being most used: every party
is both a prover and a verifier, and the number of parties might be huge.

For this reason, researches explored the possibility of having zero 
knowledge \emph{non-interactive} proof systems (ZK-NPS) or argument of knowledge systems (ZK-NARK).
The most prominent and widely used technique to achieve non-interaction is the 
\emph{Common Reference String} (CRS) model~\cite{BlumFM1988} (sometimes also called 
\emph{common random string} model).

The main idea of the CRS model is that, before engaging in the protocol, the prover and 
the verifier have both obtained access to a shared string of random bits. 
In the simplest case, the string is generated by a \emph{trusted third party}, although in 
practice this is not really a viable solution as the whole point of zero-knowledge is when dealing 
with untrusted parties, so methods have been proposed to generate the CRS by a \emph{majority vote}
between \(n\) authorities, which can be untrusted if picked singularly, but are assumed to be 
honest in their majority~\cite{GrothO2006}.
In fact, it was shown that it is possible, without losing zero-knowledge, to re-use multiple times 
a single CRS both by a single~\cite{BlumSMP1991} or multiple~\cite{FeigeLS1990} provers, although 
only for ZK-NARKs and not for ZK-NPSs.

The first zero-knowledge systems (both interactive and non) were tailor-made for specific 
problems, such as the quadratic residuosity problem \textsc{qr} or the hamiltonian path problem 
\textsc{hampath}.
It was not long after that researchers started devising constructions to prove arbitrary NP 
statements embedded in the form of boolean circuits~\cite{Damgard1993}.
This allows one to setup a ZK-NARK protocol for any NP problem without having to go through 
polynomial-time reductions~\cite{Sipser2013}.
