\section{Interactive proof systems}
Even though \NPcomplete{} problems are infeasible, they are \emph{efficient} to \emph{verify}: 
given an \emph{instance} \(\Pi \) of some \NPcomplete{} problem, and an additional \emph{witness}
string, we can build a deterministic TM that checks whether the witness \emph{proves} or 
not that the problem admits a positive answer.
\begin{example}
  Consider the problem \textsc{sat} of deciding whether a propositional logic formula \(\phi \) is 
  satisfiable, which is the most famous \NPcomplete{} problem~\cite{Cook1971}. 
  If we had a TM \(\mathcal{M}\) with access to an \emph{oracle} that, in \(\BigO{1}\) time, 
  provides a valid assignment for the variables in \(\phi \), it would be easy to 
  verify that \(\phi \) is indeed satisfiable.
  However, if the provided assignment was not valid, while \(\mathcal{M}\) would reject it, 
  there would be still no easy way to know whether \(\phi \) is actually satisfiable or not! 
\end{example}

Now, let's say we want to prove some theorem \(\Pi \): computationally, this is equivalent to 
deciding whether \(\Pi \) is word which belongs to the language of the valid propositions over some 
formal system (say, the ZFC set theory~\cite{FraenkelHL1973}).
A \emph{proof} of the theorem plays the same role of the \emph{witness} we discussed before: in 
general, verifying a proof for a theorem is (believed to be) much easier than finding the proof in 
the first place.
Hence, we can extend the logical/mathematical concept of theorem to the more computational concept 
of language: for example, by \NPtime{} theorem, we mean any language in \NPtime{}.

\begin{definition}[Interactive proof system~\cite{GoldwasserMR1989}]  
  An interactive proof system for a language \(L\) is an interactive protocol 
  \(\mathcal{I} = \Tuple{\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{V}}\), where \(\mathcal{P}\) is the \emph{prover}
  and \(\mathcal{V}\) is the \emph{verifier}, such that:
  \begin{align*}
    & \forall w \in L\colon \call{\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{w} = \top & 
      \textnormal{(\emph{correctness})} \\
    & \forall w \notin L\colon \call{\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{w} = \bot & 
      \textnormal{(\emph{completeness})} \\
    & \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\colon \call{\Time}{\mathcal{V}} = \BigO{\abs{x}^k} & 
    \textnormal{(\emph{boundness})}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

In an interactive proof system (IPS), the common input tape of \(\mathcal{P}\) and \(\mathcal{V}\)
contains some word \(w\) representing some statement: in typical scenario, the statement is 
provided by the prover himself, who wants to convince the verifier of the truthness of such 
statement.
During the protocol, \(\mathcal{P}\) and \(\mathcal{V}\) exchange messages through their 
communication tapes; at some point, \(\mathcal{P}\) sends to \(\mathcal{V}\) a candidate proof 
\(\pi \): the verifier checks the proof and, if the proof is valid, it is always convinced of its 
validity (correctness), hence it will accept. 
On the other hand, if the proof happens to be wrong (e.g.\ if \(\mathcal{P}\) is trying to deceive
\(\mathcal{V}\)), then the verifier will never be convinced by such a proof, and it will reject.
The polynomial bound on the execution time of \(\mathcal{V}\) is necessary to force cooperation, 
and avoid the case where \(\mathcal{V}\) simply ignores \(\mathcal{P}\) and computes the proof by 
itself.
\begin{definition}[Probabilistic interactive proof system~\cite{GoldwasserMR1989}]  
  A probabilistic interactive proof system for a language \(L\) is an interactive protocol 
  \(\mathcal{I} = \Tuple{\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{V}}\) such that, for any arbitrarily small 
  \(\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_{+}\):
  \begin{align*}
    & \forall w \in L\colon \call{\Pr}{\call{\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{w} = \bot} < \epsilon  & 
      \textnormal{(\emph{probabilistic correctness})} \\
    & \forall w \notin L\colon \call{\Pr}{\call{\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{w} = \top} < \epsilon & 
      \textnormal{(\emph{probabilistic completeness})} \\
    & \exists k \in \mathbb{N}\colon \call{\Time}{\mathcal{V}} = \BigO{\abs{x}^k} & 
    \textnormal{(\emph{boundness})}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
