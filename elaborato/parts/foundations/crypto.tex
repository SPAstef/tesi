\chapter{Hash Functions and Succint Proofs}\label{chap:crypto}
Cryptography, quite unsurprisingly, is the field in which zero-knowledge proof systems have 
got the most attention.
The possibility of two or more parties to cooperate and exchange information one with another in a 
zero-knowledge manner is the fundamental idea behind many branches of cryptography such as 
\emph{Multi Party Computation} (MPC)~\cite{Yao1982-2} and \emph{Fully Homomorphic Encryption} 
(FHE)~\cite{ArmknechtEtAl2015}.

An important application of zero-knowledge protocols lies in \emph{verifiable computation}:
a server (the prover) wants to convince some users (the verifiers) that some function has been 
executed properly, without revealing the inputs.

In \Cref{sec:hash_functions}, we review the fundamental notions concerning 
\emph{cryptographic hash functions}, and some of the standard ways to construct them.
In \Cref{sec:tree_hash}, we go in more depth over \emph{tree-like modes of hashing}, which 
constitute the basis of some of the most important use-cases of verifiable computation.
In \Cref{sec:zk-snark} we study the construction of zero-knowledge succint NARKs, with a focus on 
the \emph{Pinocchio} protocol~\cite{ParnoGHR2013}.
Finally, in \Cref{sec:libsnark} we describe \texttt{libsnark}, a C\texttt{++} library which 
implements (a variant of) the Pinocchio protocol.
