\chapter{Cryptographical Background}\label{chap:crypto}
The main application of Zero Knowledge proof systems has been, arguably unsurprisingly, in the 
cryptography field.
The possibility of two or more parties to cooperate and exchange information one with another in a 
zero-knowledge manner is the fundamental idea behind many branches of cryptography such as 
\emph{Multi Party Computation} (MPC)~\cite{Yao1982-2} and \emph{Fully Homomorphic Encryption} 
(FHE)~\cite{ArmknechtEtAl2015}.

The main application of Zero knowledge protocols has been in \emph{blockchain} infrastructures, 
with the cryptocurrency \emph{ZCash} being the most prominent example~\cite{SassonCGGMTV2014}.
In a public blockchain, a user (the prover) wants to convince the other users (the verifiers) that 
he posseses some data: to this end, he exhibits a \emph{commitment}, typically a short message 
which can be easily computed when knowing the original data, but for which it is hard to find a 
\emph{collision}.
In this scenario, the prover would like to be able to convince the verifiers of the validity of 
its commitment, without having to hand them out the original data.
