\chapter{Hash Functions and Succinct Proofs}\label{chap:crypto}
Cryptography, quite unsurprisingly, is the field in which zero-knowledge proof systems have 
got the most attention.
The possibility of two or more parties to cooperate in performing joint computation without 
revealing any secret or compromising privacy is the fundamental idea behind many branches of 
cryptography such as \emph{Multi Party Computation} (MPC)~\cite{Yao1982-2} and 
\emph{Fully Homomorphic Encryption} (FHE)~\cite{ArmknechtEtAl2015}.

Indeed, an important application of zero-knowledge protocols lies in \emph{verifiable computation}:
a server (the prover) wants to convince some users (the verifiers) that some function has been 
executed properly, without revealing the inputs.

In \Cref{sec:hash_functions}, we review the fundamental notions concerning 
\emph{cryptographic hash functions}, and some standard ways to construct them.
Then, in \Cref{sec:tree_hash}, we go in more depth over \emph{tree-like modes of hashing}, which 
constitute the basis of some of the most important use-cases of verifiable computation.
In \Cref{sec:zk-snark} we study the construction of zero-knowledge succinct NARK (ZK-SNARK) systems, 
with a focus on the \emph{Pinocchio} protocol~\cite{ParnoGHR2013}.
Finally, in \Cref{sec:libsnark} we describe \texttt{libsnark}, a C\texttt{++} library which 
implements (a variant of) the Pinocchio protocol.
