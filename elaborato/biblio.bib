The constructions have security approaching and in many cases equaling the security upper bounds found in previous work of the authors [24]. In particular, we describe a 2n-bit to n-bit compression function using three n-bit permutation calls that has collision security N0.5, where N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2n, and we describe 3n-bit to 2n-bit compression functions using five and six permutation calls and having collision security of at least N0.55 and N0.63.},

For instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however, this seems to contain more knowledge than the single bit Hamiltonian/non-Hamiltonian.In this paper a computational complexity theory of the “knowledge” contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic residuosity and 'quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the first examples of zero-knowledge proofs for languages not known to be efficiently recognizable.}

	abstract  = {The existence of succinct non-interactive arguments for NP (i.e., non-interactive computationally-sound proofs where the verifier's work is essentially independent of the complexity of the NP nondeterministic verifier) has been an intriguing question for the past two decades. Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model [Micali, FOCS '94], the only existing candidate construction is based on an elaborate assumption that is tailored to a specific protocol [Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa, CiE '08].We formulate a general and relatively natural notion of an extractable collision-resistant hash function (ECRH) and show that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa's protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for NP. Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations thereof.We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption.},

Readers will learn a great deal from the wealth of interesting material presented." --Andrew C. Yao, Professor of Computer Science, Princeton University "Models of Computation" is an excellent new book that thoroughly covers the theory of computation including significant recent material and presents it all with insightful new approaches. This long-awaited book will serve as a milestone for the theory community." --Akira Maruoka, Professor of Information Sciences, Tohoku University "This is computer science." --Elliot Winard, Student, Brown University In Models of Computation: Exploring the Power of Computing, John Savage re-examines theoretical computer science, offering a fresh approach that gives priority to resource tradeoffs and complexity classifications over the structure of machines and their relationships to languages. This viewpoint reflects a pedagogy motivated by the growing importance of computational models that are more realistic than the abstract ones studied in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s. Assuming onlysome background in computer organization, Models of Computation uses circuits to simulate machines with memory, thereby making possible an early discussion of P-complete and NP-complete problems. Circuits are also used to demonstrate that tradeoffs between parameters of computation, such as space and time, regulate all computations by machines with memory. Full coverage of formal languages and automata is included along with a substantive treatment of computability. Topics such as space-time tradeoffs, memory hierarchies, parallel computation, and circuit complexity, are integrated throughout the text with an emphasis on finite problems and concrete computational models FEATURES: Includes introductory material for a first course on theoretical computer science. Builds on computer organization to provide an early introduction to P-complete and NP-complete problems. Includes a concise, modern presentation of regular, context-free and phrase-structure grammars, parsing, finite automata, pushdown automata, and computability. Includes an extensive, modern coverage of complexity classes. Provides an introduction to the advanced topics of space-time tradeoffs, memory hierarchies, parallel computation, the VLSI model, and circuit complexity, with parallelism integrated throughout. Contains over 200 figures and over 400 exercises along with an extensive bibliography. ** Instructor's materials are available from your sales rep.

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second.

It can be proven equivalent to a cascade of sponge functions and hence inherits its security against single-stage generic attacks. The main application proposed here is an authenticated encryption mode based on the duplex construction. This mode is efficient, namely, enciphering and authenticating together require only a single call to the underlying permutation per block, and is readily usable in, e.g., key wrapping. Furthermore, it is the first mode of this kind to be directly based on a permutation instead of a block cipher and to natively support intermediate tags. The duplex construction can be used to efficiently realize other modes, such as a reseedable pseudo-random bit sequence generators and a sponge variant that overwrites part of the state with the input block rather than to XOR it in.},

The security of this implementation is proved under the interactability assumptin of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown.}

With this protocol, we can prove an arbitrary NP-statement non-interactively without using Karp-reductions to 3-SAT or Graph Hamiltonicity. The proof system is based on the quadratic residuosity problem and allows processing of XOR and NOT gates at virtually no cost. It is significantly more efficient than previously known non-interactive proof systems. In the second part, we present protocols based on the existence of collision intractable hash functions, leading to a statistical zero-knowledge non-interactive argument with preprocessing for any NP-statement. Under the certified discrete log assumption, the protocol is perfect zero-knowledge. In the preprocessing, the parties need only exchange messages of length independent of the theorem to be proved later. This is the first protocol with such efficient preprocessing that does not need to assume oblivious transfer. Finally we present a perfect zero-knowledge non-interactive protocol based on discrete logarithms that may potentially remove the need for preprocessing.},

	abstract = {The wide applicability of zero-knowledge interactive proofs comes from the possibility of using these proofs as subroutines in cryptographic protocols. A basic question concerning this use is whether the (sequential and/or parallel) composition of zero-knowledge protocols is zero-knowledge too. We demonstrate the limitations of the composition of zero-knowledge protocols by proving that the original definition of zero-knowledge is not closed under sequential composition; and that even the strong formulations of zero-knowledge (e.g., black-box simulation) are not closed under parallel execution.We present lower bounds on the round complexity of zero-knowledge proofs, with significant implications for the parallelization of zero-knowledge protocols. We prove that three-round interactive proofs and constant-round Arthur-Merlin proofs that are black-box simulation zero-knowledge exist only for languages in BPP. In particular, it follows that the “parallel versions” of the first interactive proofs systems presented for quadratic residuosity, graph isomorphism, and any language in NP, are not black-box simulation zero-knowledge, unless the corresponding languages are in BPP Whether these parallel versions constitute zero-knowledge proofs was an intriguing open questions arising from the early works on zero-knowledge. Other consequences are a proof of optimality for the round complexity of various known zero-knowledge protocols and the necessity of using secret coins in the design of “parallelizable” constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. }

We use bit commitments of size k  and bound the probability of false proofs going undetected by 2-r. We obtain non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of size O(mk(  log m +r))  bits. In the random oracle model, we obtain non-interactive proofs of size O(m(  log m+r) + rk)  bits.

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

Finally, if a special type of computationally sound proof exists, we show that Blum's notion of program checking can be meaningfully broadened so as to prove that $cal N cal P$-complete languages are checkable.},

This construction is the first in the ideal bit commitment model that achieves large values of k more efficiently than by running k independent iterations of the base interactive proof system. Under suitable complexity assumptions, we exhibit zero knowledge arguments that require O(lgc|x|kl bits of communication, where c depends only on L, and l is the security parameter for the prover. This is the first construction in which the total amount of communication can be less than that needed to transmit the NP witness. Our protocols are based on efficiently checkable proofs for NP[4].},
