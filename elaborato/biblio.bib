The constructions have security approaching and in many cases equaling the security upper bounds found in previous work of the authors [24]. In particular, we describe a 2n-bit to n-bit compression function using three n-bit permutation calls that has collision security N0.5, where N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2n, and we describe 3n-bit to 2n-bit compression functions using five and six permutation calls and having collision security of at least N0.55 and N0.63.},

For instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however, this seems to contain more knowledge than the single bit Hamiltonian/non-Hamiltonian.In this paper a computational complexity theory of the “knowledge” contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic residuosity and 'quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the first examples of zero-knowledge proofs for languages not known to be efficiently recognizable.}

	abstract  = {The existence of succinct non-interactive arguments for NP (i.e., non-interactive computationally-sound proofs where the verifier's work is essentially independent of the complexity of the NP nondeterministic verifier) has been an intriguing question for the past two decades. Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model [Micali, FOCS '94], the only existing candidate construction is based on an elaborate assumption that is tailored to a specific protocol [Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa, CiE '08].We formulate a general and relatively natural notion of an extractable collision-resistant hash function (ECRH) and show that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa's protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for NP. Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations thereof.We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption.},

Readers will learn a great deal from the wealth of interesting material presented." --Andrew C. Yao, Professor of Computer Science, Princeton University "Models of Computation" is an excellent new book that thoroughly covers the theory of computation including significant recent material and presents it all with insightful new approaches. This long-awaited book will serve as a milestone for the theory community." --Akira Maruoka, Professor of Information Sciences, Tohoku University "This is computer science." --Elliot Winard, Student, Brown University In Models of Computation: Exploring the Power of Computing, John Savage re-examines theoretical computer science, offering a fresh approach that gives priority to resource tradeoffs and complexity classifications over the structure of machines and their relationships to languages. This viewpoint reflects a pedagogy motivated by the growing importance of computational models that are more realistic than the abstract ones studied in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s. Assuming onlysome background in computer organization, Models of Computation uses circuits to simulate machines with memory, thereby making possible an early discussion of P-complete and NP-complete problems. Circuits are also used to demonstrate that tradeoffs between parameters of computation, such as space and time, regulate all computations by machines with memory. Full coverage of formal languages and automata is included along with a substantive treatment of computability. Topics such as space-time tradeoffs, memory hierarchies, parallel computation, and circuit complexity, are integrated throughout the text with an emphasis on finite problems and concrete computational models FEATURES: Includes introductory material for a first course on theoretical computer science. Builds on computer organization to provide an early introduction to P-complete and NP-complete problems. Includes a concise, modern presentation of regular, context-free and phrase-structure grammars, parsing, finite automata, pushdown automata, and computability. Includes an extensive, modern coverage of complexity classes. Provides an introduction to the advanced topics of space-time tradeoffs, memory hierarchies, parallel computation, the VLSI model, and circuit complexity, with parallelism integrated throughout. Contains over 200 figures and over 400 exercises along with an extensive bibliography. ** Instructor's materials are available from your sales rep.

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second.
